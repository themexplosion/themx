Themx
===

Hi. I'm a starter theme called `themx`. I'm a theme quipped with - `Tailwindcss` and `Theme Helper Functions`. That makes me powerful enough to start right on.

My ultra-minimal CSS will ease your starting process. That makes me a cute little starter template.
 
* A modern workflow with necessary files to start a theme.
* HTML5 semantic elements included with proper commenting.
* A powerful framework, i.e - `Codestar Framework` support added to the theme. The core functionality comes from the support plugin called `Themx-Core`. Admin options, menu options, metaboxes etc. 
  are included.
